# GCStarPlugins
This repository is a 'fork' from [GCstar](http://www.gcstar.org/index.en.php) aimed to improve the Plugins that search for books information on many hosts.

    GCstar is a free open source application for managing your collections.
    Detailed information on each item can be automatically retrieved from the internet
    and you can store additional data, such as the location or who you've lent it to.
    You may also search and filter your collection by many criteria.
    GCstar is delivered under the terms of the GNU General Public License
    It can be used on any operating systems on which gtk2-perl is available.
